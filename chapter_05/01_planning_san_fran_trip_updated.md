You planned this itinerary for me:
Day 1: Explore OpenAI HQ and AI exhibits at Exploratorium
Day 2: Visit Stanford AI Lab and Palo Alto innovation hubs
Day 3: Attend tech meetups, tour AI startups in SoMa

However, the Exploratorium is closed the first and we there is no startups to tour. 
Update my itinerary.
